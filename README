Here you're gonna find an old social network I was trying to do for the university, 
is not a project I'm looking to improve is just a memory to keep in my repos. 

So I basically was trying to build an MVC framework from scratch , but I end up doing a lot of spaghetti code also 
theres a lot of lack of code conventions. JS/CSS same story.
